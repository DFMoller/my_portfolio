					<h2>Porche's new Brake Rotors</h2>
					<div class="idea-date">
						<p>July 27, Monday</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="idea-description">
					<p>There have been many examples of people attempting to "reinvent the wheel" just before realizing that the wheel is round for a reason. However, Porsche's attempt to rethink the common brake rotor has proven quite successful thus far. These rotors are coated with a thin layer of thungsten carbide which gives it an extremely hard finish. This means there is less brake fade and less brake dust than carbon ceramic rotors have and they last up to 30% longer than conventional iron brake rotors.</p>

					<h2>Steering the Saturn V</h2>
					<div class="idea-date">
						<p>July 20, Monday</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="idea-description">
					<p>Smarter Every Day is another one of my favourite YouTube channels and is run by a guy named Destin. Destin explores a very wide variety of engineering applications and all his videos are educational, yet fun to watch.<br>Here, he takes a look at the memory module that was used to steer the Saturn V rocket to the moon. The technology used back then seems lightyears behind what is being done with computers today and yet, I could understand everything he spoke about with the knowledge gained from studying computer systems in engineering (2020).</p>

					<h2>How safe is a Sawstop?</h2>
					<div class="idea-date">
						<p>July 13, Monday</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="idea-description">
					<p>If you're anything like me and have tried doing some woodwork at some point using only the most basic of tools, you'll have heard of a table saw, but never used one. Similarly, I've heard of the countless injuries people have suffered using these. However, some of the more advanced table saws have recently become much more safe. A tablesaw like this uses a sawstop system that can detect when human flesh comes into contact with the saw teeth and stops the blade instantly. This is a very interesting watch.</p>

					<h2>What's on a US fire truck?</h2>
					<div class="idea-date">
						<p>July 6, Monday</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="idea-description">
					<p>This week's topic is perhaps not as helpful as some of the others, but should be interesting to the curious among us.<br>Ever wonder what actually goes on inside a fire truck? Neither did I. But here it is in any case. I should add that it is worth giving this YouTube channel (Donut Media) a try. They cover a range of random interesting topics like this.</p>

					<h2>Flexbox</h2>
					<div class="idea-date">
						<p>June 29, Monday</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="idea-description">
					<p>Following the CSS topic of last week, this time I'm linking a Flexbox tutorial, again by the YouTuber, Dev Ed. Flexbox (flexible box layout) is another very powerful tool to be used with CSS. It allows responsive elements within a container to be arranged automatically, depending on screen size.<br>Anyone trying to build a website with CSS amongst other languages, undoubtedly should use Flexbox and/or CSS grid as mentioned last week. </p>

					<h2>CSS Grid Crash Course</h2>
					<div class="idea-date">
						<p>June 22, Monday</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="idea-description">
					<p>For someone in the process of getting to grips with CSS, it is very helpful to understand CSS grid and how to implement it. It is quite useful when spacing out items on a website and its power lies in its scalability when moving between different sized displays.<br>This is another one of Dev Ed's YouTube tutorials that demonstrates the power of CSS grid.</p>

					<p>DIY Perks is probably the only DIY channel on YouTube that is not filled with useless gimmicky content. Matt makes videos showing all kinds of usefull ways of repurposing old hardware from computers (and other sources). Some projects are more complicated than others, but all are inspiring and entertaining to watch.<br>Here, he shows exactly how to build a fully funcioning 4K projector from scratch while considering important things such as ventilation.</p>

					<h2>Software - Falcon 9 & Dragon</h2>

				<div class="idea-description">
					<p>Rocket Science. The term is often used to refer to something extremely complex that rarely has any relevance to rockets. This has fostered an assumption that all things rocket-related are far beyond the understanding of the average person while, in actual fact, many concepts are not that hard to grasp.<br>This clip explains some of the software used by SpaceX in a way that is easy to follow and it sheds some light on this topic.</p>

					<p>Crew Dragon is the capsule SpaceX intends use to send two astronauts to the international space station (ISS) on 27 May 2020. It carries some significance as it will be the first time a private company (SpaceX) takes people so the ISS. It will also be the first time astronauts are launched from American soil this decade, but its really only american patriots that care about that.<br>

					<h2>Building SVG Animations With CSS</h2>

						<p>May 11, Monday</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="idea-description">
					<p>Dev Ed is a popular YouTuber that has a ton of helpful content on learning Web Development and other related skills. The shared video shows how he explains the details of animating SVG files using CSS.<br>Even though I have no animation background (at time of writing this post), I learned a lot from his video and can conclude that this approach to animation for web interfaces is particularly helpful to someone that already knows CSS.</p>
